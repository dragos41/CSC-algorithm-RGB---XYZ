Implementation in Python of an environment for checking the CSC algorithm (Color Space Conversion; only from RGB to XYZ format and vice versa).

Task 1
- Checking the correctness of your own implementation:
1. Opening an image and reading the pixel values (R,G,B), writing them into one file
2. Applying the CSC transformation (RGB -> XYZ) to the pixel values in the file; The new values are they will write everything in a file
3. Applying the inverse transformation to the XYZ values obtained in point 2)
4. Recreating the image from the pixel values from point 3)

Task 2:
Checking the correctness of an algorithm implemented by me in Verilog:
1. Applying the XYZ -> RGB transform on the file received from me
2. Recreating the image from the file obtained at the previous point, which must be similar
with the one attached.
